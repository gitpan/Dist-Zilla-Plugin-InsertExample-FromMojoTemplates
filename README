NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertExample::FromMojoTemplates - Creates POD
    examples from custom Mojolicious templates.

SYNOPSIS
      ; In dist.ini
      [InsertExample::FromMojoTemplates]
      directory = examples/source
      filepattern = ^\w+-\d+\.mojo$

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertExample::FromMojoTemplates inserts examples
    from MojoX::CustomTemplateFileParser type files into POD. Together with
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CreateFromMojo this produces examples in POD
    from the same source that creates the tests. The purpose is to help
    develop tag helpers for Mojolicious.

  Attributes
    "directory"

    Default: "examples/source"

    Where DZP::IE::FMT should look for source files.

    "filepattern"

    Default: "^\w+-\d+\.mojo$"

    Look for files that matches a certain pattern.

    "make_examples"

    Default: 1

    If true, will create html files in the chosen directory.

    "example_directory"

    Default: "examples"

    The directory for html files.

  USAGE
    Source files looks like this:

       ==test example 1==
        --t--
            %= link_to 'The example 3' => ['http://www.perl.org/']
        --t--
        --e--
            <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>
        --e--

    This is a test block. One file can have many test blocks.

    In your pod:

        # EXAMPLE: filename.mojo:1, 3-30, !5, !22-26

        # EXAMPLE: filename.mojo:all

        # EXAMPLE: filename.mojo:examples

    "all"

    Adds all examples in the source file. "all" can be used by itself or
    combined with exclusion commands.

    1

    Adds example number 3. The test number is sequential. Looping tests
    count as one. You can add a number as in the example to make it easier
    to follow.

    "3-30"

    Add examples numbered 5 through 30.

    "!5"

    Excludes example 5 from the previous range.

    "!22-26"

    Excludes examples numbered "22-26" from the previous range. If an
    example has been excluded it can't be included later. Exclusions are
    final.

    "examples"

    Includes all tests marked "==test example==" in the source file.
    Exclusion works as with "all".
